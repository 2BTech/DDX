2015/5/27:  Ideas for instrument profiles.  Have three separate files:
- standard:  Downloaded from 2B.  Basic configuration of all files
- custom:  Maintains any custom profiles developed by 2B for specific customers
- generated:  Saves the profiles generated for specific instruments
When an instrument is detected, the application will search for a compatible profile first in generated,
then in custom, and finally in standard.  If the instrument was not in generated,an entry for it will
be added to generated.

2015/6/24:  This is an awesome set of guides, I wish I'd known about it earlier:  http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/overviews-main.html
